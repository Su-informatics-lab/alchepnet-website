			</p>
			<h4>Pharmacological Class of the Drugs</h4>
			<p class="lead">
				<ol type="a">
					<li>Anakinra is immunological agent, an inhibitor of the Interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1).</li>
					<li>Prednisone is an adrenal glucocorticoid.</li>
					<li>Zinc-sulfate is a nutritional supplement.</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<h4>Indication</h4>
			<p class="lead">
				Severe alcoholic hepatitis.
			</p>
			
			<h4>Study Type</h4>
			<p class="lead">
				Phase 2B multicenter randomized, 2-arm, double blinded, placebo controlled clinical trial.
			</p>
			
			<h4>Investigational Sites</h4>
			<p class="lead">
				Indiana University, Mayo Clinic, Virginia Commonwealth University, Cleveland Clinic
Foundation, University of Louisville, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center, and University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center
			</p>
			
			<h4>Planned Number of Participants</h4>
			<p class="lead">
				Approximately 258 participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into 1 of 2 treatment arms (129
participants per arm): (1) Prednisone + Placebo for Anakinra/Zinc (2) Anakinra + Zinc
+ Placebo for Prednisone.
			</p>
			
			<h4>Objectives</h4>
			<p class="lead">
				This multicenter, randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial is focused on novel
treatments for severe alcoholic hepatitis (AH), a life-threatening stage of alcoholic liver injury that
has a short-term mortality rate much higher than that of other liver diseases.
			</p>
			<p class="lead">
				The primary objective of the study is to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of Anakinra (plus
zinc) compared to the current standard medical treatment consisting of prednisone in participants 
with clinically severe AH. Key secondary
objectives broadly are as follows: (a) to evaluate the use of biomarkers to assess disease severity
and treatment response; and (b) to develop novel endpoints to overcome the limitations of current
assessment strategies for severe AH.
			</p>
			
			<h4>Overview of Study Design and Conduct</h4>
			<p class="lead">
				The proposed study is a Phase 2b, multicenter, prospective, randomized, 2-arm, double blinded,
placebo-controlled clinical trial to assess the efficacy of Anakinra, an interleukin (IL)-1 receptor
antagonist plus zinc compared to prednisone for the treatment of severe AH (Model
for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score â‰¥ 20). All participants will receive standard care for
treatment of severe AH as described in recent guidelines endorsed by American Association for
the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and American Gastroenterological Association (AGA).
The study will be conducted at 8 clinical sites across the United Stated selected by the National
Institute of Alcoholic Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) and will be supported by a Data
Coordinating Center at Indiana University (DCC-IU). The biorepository will be managed by
University of Massachusetts.
			</p>
			<p class="lead">
				The study will be conducted according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and in compliance with
local, state and federal regulatory requirements. Adverse events during the course of the trial will
be identified, recorded, assessed for causality, and reported in accordance with FDA guidance. In
addition to general assessment, we will specifically focus on (1) rates and types of infection as well
as their severity, (2) potential development of drug-induced liver injury, (3) injection site reactions,
and (4) hematological adverse events.
			</p>
			<p class="lead">
				This study will be approved by an appropriately convened single IRB, Western Institutional
Review Board (WIRB), and will be monitored by an NIAAA appointed Data and Safety
Monitoring Board (DSMB). We will conduct this study under an Investigational New Drug (IND)
application from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
			</p>
			<p class="lead">
				It is anticipated that a centrally located investigational pharmacy located at Indiana University will
dispense the study medications to all participating sites under close coordination from the DCC-IU.
Anakinra plus zinc, prednisone
and matching placebos will be provided by the
study to the participants.

			<h4>Interventions to be tested</h4>
			<p class="lead">
				Concomitant treatments in this trial include
standard care for severe AH for all participants
as recommended in recent guidelines
<sup>

        data-html="true"
        title="O'Shea RS, Dasarathy S, McCullough AJ, Practice Guideline Committee of the American Association for the Study of Liver D, Practice Parameters Committee of the American College of G. Alcoholic liver disease. <i>Hepatology</i>. 2010;51(1):307-328.">1</a></sup>. The
standard of care for severe AH includes
attention to early diagnosis and treatment of
bacterial and fungal infections, portal
hypertension and its complications including
acute kidney injury, gastrointestinal bleeding, fluid overload (ascites and edema) and hepatic
encephalopathy.</p> 

            <p class="lead">
In addition, all participants will be offered as part of the standard of care, non-pharmacologic
intervention for treatment of alcohol use disorders, such as cognitive behavioral
therapy and 12-step programs intervention as aligned with the best practices at the participating
study site.
			</p>
			<p class="lead">
				Participants with severe AH are very sick and often have multiple active medical problems
requiring intervention. The use of specific interventions during this time has the potential to
modify treatment response. Ideally, these interventions would be completely standardized.
However, the standard of care varies by region, institution and the specialties involved in the care
of the participant. The decision regarding treatments for these complications will be delegated to
the primary physicians caring for the participants during hospitalizations and to the investigators
during the ambulatory follow-up of the participants. Other than the general guidelines noted, no
specific treatments for specific complications such as those noted are required. However, such
treatments might include, but are not limited to the administration of IV fluids, intravenous human
serum albumin, antibiotics including antifungal medications, renal replacement therapy,
supplemental oxygen, assisted ventilation and intravenous pressors. Diagnostic procedures such
as paracentesis, upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound and liver biopsy will be
permitted as required to provide standard care.
			</p>
			<p class="lead">
				During the initial six months of trial, the investigators will develop a "manual of clinical
operations" that will include best practices on the use of vasopressors, albumin, ICU care,
mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy using Surviving Sepsis Campaign,
International Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock. The investigators
will also provide best practices for management of nutrition and alcohol counseling and
minimization of recidivism. Although the management of these complications will not be
mandated by protocol, the care provided will be recorded to develop novel designs for future trials
and for practice guidance and quality improvement programs.
			</p>
			<p class="lead">
				After informed consent has been obtained and all of the inclusion are met and none of the
exclusion, participants will be randomized to receive one of the following interventions in addition
to standard care.
			</p>
			<p class="lead">
				<b>Group 1:</b> Standard of care <b>plus</b> prednisone 40 mg orally once daily on Days 1-30 and matching
placebos for Anakinra (1 syringe s.c. once daily on Days 1-14), and zinc (matched pill once daily on Days 1-90).
			</p>
			<p class="lead">
				<b>Group 2:</b> Standard of care <b>plus</b> Anakinra (100 mg s.c.) once daily on Days 1-14
zinc sulfate 220 mg once daily on Days 1-90, and placebo for prednisone (matched pill once daily on Days 1-30).

			<h4>Primary and Important Secondary Endpoints</h4>
			<h5>Primary Endpoints</h5>
			<p class="lead">
				Survival at 90 days
			</p>
			<h5>Secondary Endpoints</h5>
			<ul class="lead">
				<li>
					<b>Changes in score(s):</b> Changes in Lille score, change in MELD score, development of AKI,
multi-organ failure, SIRS, transfer to ICU, changes in liver function will all be evaluated at 7,
30 and 90 days.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Organ dysfunction:</b> Measure of changes in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)
scores and proportions requiring hemodynamic support for MAP < 65 mm Hg and lactate >
2 mmol/l, renal replacement therapy or mechanical ventilation. The SOFA score will be
modified and re-evaluated without platelet counts given that these are usually low in AH.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Infections and Sepsis:</b> The endpoints and case definitions related to sepsis may vary
depending on what will be used (clinical care, research, surveillance or quality improvement).
Given the central role of sepsis as a driver of outcomes, measuring the types of infection will
occur but also identify the proportions of those with sepsis, septic shock or quick-SOFA
(qSOFA) criteria based on SEPSIS-3 guidance<sup>

</sup>. Key parameters will be captured and needed
for various sepsis related endpoint construction aligned by the recent guidance from the
European Drug Development Hub (<a href="http://eddh-cro.wixsite.com/fdtsfv">http://eddh-cro.wixsite.com/fdtsfv</a>).

AKI development will be quantified and its progression through persistent AKI, acute kidney
disease to chronic kidney disease.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Need for care escalation:</b> Proportion of participants requiring transfer to ICU for care,
intubation for airway control, need for ventilator support or RRT.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Indicators of gut permeability:</b> (endotoxin and bacterial 18S DNA) and pro-inflammatory
cytokine/chemokines (TNFa, MCP1, IL-6, IL-1ÃŸ) will be assessed in serum/plasma samples.

				<li>
					<b>Survival at 30 days and 180 days</b>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>Limitations of mortality as an endpoint in AH and plans to overcome these</h5>
			<p class="lead">
				All-cause mortality is most relevant when mortality is substantial and attributable to a single
mechanism in a homogeneous population. Participants with severe AH are highly heterogeneous
with respect to disease severity, end organ involvement and the care they receive. Moreover, as in
sepsis and heart failure, death involves failure of multiple organs (liver, heart, kidney, lungs)
making it difficult to ascertain which one is the primary cause of death. This has led to
development and regulatory acceptance of composite endpoints including mortality and key
parameters driving mortality for acute heart failure trials. These guiding principles to construct a
novel and innovative key secondary composite endpoint which will include death or worsening of
the modified SOFA score<sup>
    <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-html="true" title="Duseja A, Choudhary NS, Gupta S, Dhiman RK, Chawla Y. APACHE II score is superior to SOFA, CTP and MELD in predicting the short-term mortality in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). <i>J Dig Dis</i>. 2013;14(9):484-490.">4</a>,
    <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-html="true" title="Kim HY, Kim CW, Kim TY, et al. Assessment of scoring systems for acute-on-chronic liver failure at predicting short-term mortality in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. <i>World journal of gastroenterology</i>. 2016;22(41):9205-9213.">5</a>
</sup> by â‰¥2 points and worsening of MELD score by â‰¥2 points. These are
associated with mortality and capture the organ recruitment that marks progression of AH towards
death. This endpoint will also be validated with respect to reliability, construct-, criterion- and
content validity to establish this as a primary endpoint in future trials. Model changes in SOFA
scores and MELD scores against mortality to further optimize this endpoint and cross-validate it
in the observation cohort will occur.
        </p>
			<h4>Novel (experimental) endpoints to overcome limitations of conventional endpoints</h4>
			<p class="lead">
				Efficacy endpoints must capture "clinically meaningful benefit". While traditional endpoints such
as mortality are meaningful, they also have multiple shortcomings in the context of AH as noted
below. Innovation will be used to construct, measure and validate novel additional endpoints to
overcome the limitations of currently used endpoints and cross-validate them in the observational
cohort. The combined expertise in endpoint development and the use of harmonized
measurements will make this feasible. These will provide novel assessments in AH and provide
the scientific evidence-base to use these as primary endpoints in future trials.
