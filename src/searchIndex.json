    "content": "Biorepository The AlcHepNet Biorepository is a part of the Indiana University Data Coordinating Center (DCC). Its primary function is to support biospecimen collection for ongoing AlcHepNet studies. The DCC oversees the operation of the biorepository in partnership with the Indiana University Genetics Biobank (IUGB), which is a state-of-the-art facility for biospecimen storage, tracking, and distribution. The biorepository team uses a comprehensive, searchable database to manage all biospecimens and the associated metadata. The DCC provides a link between stored biospecimen data to facilitate research. Team I suggest you list Linus first, followed by Whitney and then others. Give the contact info only if you let users contact them. In this case, maybe just the contact info for Linus and Whitney. IUGB: (make sure we use names consistently: IUGB is formerly known as the Indiana Biobank. If that is the official name, we should use that name to minimize confusion. We don't need to repeat the info from the Indiana Biobank website. We just need to create a link https://indianabiobank.org) About Indiana Biobank The Indiana Biobank, also known as the Indiana University Genetic Biobank, is a statewide initiative, co-developed by Indiana University School of Medicine and IU Health, to collect blood specimens through the Indiana Biobank for genomic sequencing. The specimens and information can be used in research to develop better treatments for diseases today and in the future. The Indiana Biobank is partnering with AlcHepNet to manage the specimens collected from AlcHepNet studies. $(function() { $(\"#navbar-include\").load(\"../navbar.html\", function() { $(\"#navbar-include a\").each(function() { var href = $(this).attr(\"href\"); if (href && !href.startsWith(\"http\") && !href.startsWith(\"#\")) { $(this).attr(\"href\", \"../\" + href); } }); $(\"#navbar-include img\").each(function() { var src = $(this).attr(\"src\"); if (src && !src.startsWith(\"http\") && !src.startsWith(\"data:\")) { $(this).attr(\"src\", \"../\" + src); } }); console.log('Navbar loaded and links updated'); }); $(\"#search-modal-include\").load(\"../search-modal.html\"); $(\"#footer-include\").load(\"../footer.html\", function() { console.log('Footer loaded'); }); });"

Mission Statement The goal of the Indiana Biobank is to aid researchers in discovery research that may lead to better ways to treat and prevent diseases. The Indiana Biobank works towards this goal by providing researchers with the tools and resources they need to advance their research. About the Indiana Biobank The Indiana Biobank was established in 2010 and is intended to be a resource to promote discovery research. We offer a variety of services to meet this aim. Each year, we provide researchers over 4000 sample collection kits, bank samples for over 30 biobanks, support over 15 targeted collections, distribute thousands of specimens and omics data, and collect over 10,000 specimens for broad sharing. Currently, over 50,000 patients have consented to be a part of the Indiana Biobank. The Indiana Biobank is a part of the Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute (CTSI). The CTSI is a statewide collaboration of scientists at Indiana University, Purdue University, and the University of Notre Dame, as well as public and private partnerships. Who is using our services? Since 2010, the Indiana Biobank has supported hundreds of academic and commercial researchers through services and distributed thousands of specimens to aid in discovery research in a variety of therapeutic areas. Erin Conboy, MD Assistant Professor of Clinical Medical and Molecular Genetics, Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics and PediatricsIndiana University School of Medicine \"The Indiana Biobank provides sample collection kits, sample processing, and distribution services for our Undiagnosed and Rare Disease Clinic. They also work with us to make sure our samples are distributed quickly and efficiently, helping our comprehensive genetic and metabolic testing and analysis run smoothly as our researchers work together to look for answers for families in Indiana.\" David Haas, MD Robert A. Munsick Professor of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Department of Obstetrics and GynecologyIndiana University School of Medicine \"I appreciate how flexible the Indiana Biobank team is. Our project is a multi-year, multi-site, and multi-visit study focused on pregnant mothers and their babies. As we continue to develop and design the most efficient workflow, the Indiana Biobank team works with us to support our project's evolving needs.\" Melissa Kacena, PhD Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery, Department of Orthopaedic SurgeryIndiana University School of Medicine \"The Indiana Biobank worked quickly to provide me with high quality samples and clinical data for my COVID-19 research. They have been incredibly accommodating and efficient as we work through the pandemic. I would encourage other investigators to use them as a resource.\" Nabil Adra, MD Assistant Professor of Clinical Medicine, Assistant Professor of Urology, Director, Genitourinary OncologyIndiana University Simon Comprehensive Cancer Center \"The Indiana Biobank supports my research by providing kits, sample processing, storage, and sample distribution services for my biobanks.

Kleit Professor of MedicineIndiana University School of Medicine, Scientific Director, Indiana Biobank \"The Indiana Biobank has been a key partner of the Indiana Center for Musculoskeletal Health since the inception of the Center. The Indiana Biobank staff worked with us to design several blood and tissue sample collections. They have also worked with us to develop an online sample catalog to help our collaborators determine which samples meet their research needs. We look forward to our continued partnership with the Indiana Biobank to accelerate discoveries and understanding in musculoskeletal health.\" Dongbing Lai, PhD Assistant Research Professor of Medical & Molecular Genetics, Department of Medical and Molecular GeneticsIndiana University School of Medicine \"The Indiana Biobank provided me with over 3,600 DNA samples for my collaboration with the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). The Biobank team worked with me to design a query to identify cases and controls of interest for my research. They also provided me with health information for each sample. In addition to samples, I have also received GWAS data from the Indiana Biobank to support my research looking at the genetics factor of substance use disorders and related diseases. Their team has been great to work with, and I would highly recommend working with them.\" Indiana Biobank The Indiana Biobank is a statewide initiative, co-developed by Indiana University School of Medicine and IU Health to collect blood specimens through the Indiana Biobank for genomic sequencing. The specimens and information can be used in research to find better treatments for diseases of today and the future. IU Health patients can participate in this effort by donating blood samples. Patients who are already in the lab for a scheduled blood draw can consent in-person or may consent remotely for a future draw. The Indiana Biobank can also use blood specimens left over from other procedures. Patients who participate are automatically enrolled in the All IN for Health program initiative and will receive a newsletter that provides resources for good health and opportunities to participate in more health research and clinical studies. The goal of the project is to enroll 300,000 IU Health patients over the next five years. Here are some frequently asked questions about the Indiana Biobank.

To do this, we will obtain blood, urine, and stool samples (e.g., biological samples) and personal health information from you to use in future research studies related to alcohol-associated hepatitis or other diseases. Part of your blood sample will be used to extract your DNA. DNA is the genetic material that gives us unique characteristics. We are doing this research study because we are trying to find out more about how and why illnesses related to alcohol-associated hepatitis or other diseases occur in people. To do this, we will study the biological samples and personal health information from healthy and sick people. A \"biological sample\" is usually blood, but can be any body fluid. \"Personal Health Information\" includes such items as your name, age, gender, race, and/or your medical information. It can also include data from measurements and tests that you had while participating in another research study or that were done during the course of your regular medical care or doctor visits. Study Type Prospective, observational study Investigational Sites Indiana University; University of Louisville affiliated hospitals in Kentucky; University of Massachusetts Medical Center in Massachusetts; Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota; Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Ohio; University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Pennsylvania; University of Texas at Southwestern in Dallas, Texas; and Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Virginia Planned Number of Patients Approximately 1260 (720 subjects with alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH), 360 heavy drinkers without AH, and 180 healthy donors) will be enrolled. Objectives PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To collect and store clinical data to facilitate investigations of the epidemiology, diagnosis, pathophysiology, natural history, and treatment of alcohol-associated hepatitis. SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: To develop a bio-specimen bank comprised of plasma, DNA, and other biological specimens obtained from patients with alcohol-associated hepatitis, heavy drinkers without clinical liver disease, and healthy subjects to support translational research in the pathophysiology of alcohol-associated hepatitis Methodology Screening phase: Subjects will be assessed for the eligibility criteria and a written informed consent will be obtained from the eligible subjects. Study phase: Subjects will undergo history taking, physical examination, questionnaire administration, and laboratory tests. Biosamples including serum/plasma, peripheral mononuclear cells (at select sites), genomic DNA, stool samples (when available), urine, and liver tissue (where available) will be obtained. Follow up phase: Alcohol-associated hepatitis subjects will be followed for 360 days, Heavy drinking controls for 180 days, and healthy controls subjects for 1 day (at initial meeting for baseline). $(function () { $(\"#navbar-include\").load(\"../navbar.html\", function () { $(\"#navbar-include a\").each(function() { var href = $(this).attr(\"href\"); if (href && !href.startsWith(\"http\") && !href.startsWith(\"#\")) { $(this).attr(\"href\", \"../\" + href); } }); $(\"#navbar-include img\").each(function() { var src = $(this).attr(\"src\"); if (src && !src.startsWith(\"http\") && !src.startsWith(\"data:\")) { $(this).attr(\"src\", \"../\" + src); } }); console.log('Navbar loaded and links updated'); }); $(\"#search-modal-include\").load(\"../search-modal.html\"); $(\"#footer-include\").load(\"../footer.html\", function () { console.log('Footer loaded'); }); });"

Name of Active Ingredient(s) Anakinra Prednisone Zinc-Sulfate Pharmacological Class of the Drugs Anakinra is immunological agent, an inhibitor of the Interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1). Prednisone is an adrenal glucocorticoid. Zinc-sulfate is a nutritional supplement. Indication Severe alcoholic hepatitis. Study Type Phase 2B multicenter randomized, 2-arm, double blinded, placebo controlled clinical trial. Investigational Sites Indiana University, Mayo Clinic, Virginia Commonwealth University, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, University of Louisville, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Planned Number of Participants Approximately 258 participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into 1 of 2 treatment arms (129 participants per arm): (1) Prednisone + Placebo for Anakinra/Zinc (2) Anakinra + Zinc + Placebo for Prednisone. Objectives This multicenter, randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial is focused on novel treatments for severe alcoholic hepatitis (AH), a life-threatening stage of alcoholic liver injury that has a short-term mortality rate much higher than that of other liver diseases. The primary objective of the study is to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of Anakinra (plus zinc) compared to the current standard medical treatment consisting of prednisone in participants with clinically severe AH. Key secondary objectives broadly are as follows: (a) to evaluate the use of biomarkers to assess disease severity and treatment response; and (b) to develop novel endpoints to overcome the limitations of current assessment strategies for severe AH. Overview of Study Design and Conduct The proposed study is a Phase 2b, multicenter, prospective, randomized, 2-arm, double blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial to assess the efficacy of Anakinra, an interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist plus zinc compared to prednisone for the treatment of severe AH (Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score ≥ 20). All participants will receive standard care for treatment of severe AH as described in recent guidelines endorsed by American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and American Gastroenterological Association (AGA). The study will be conducted at 8 clinical sites across the United Stated selected by the National Institute of Alcoholic Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) and will be supported by a Data Coordinating Center at Indiana University (DCC-IU). The biorepository will be managed by University of Massachusetts. The study will be conducted according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and in compliance with local, state and federal regulatory requirements. Adverse events during the course of the trial will be identified, recorded, assessed for causality, and reported in accordance with FDA guidance. In addition to general assessment, we will specifically focus on (1) rates and types of infection as well as their severity, (2) potential development of drug-induced liver injury, (3) injection site reactions, and (4) hematological adverse events. This study will be approved by an appropriately convened single IRB, Western Institutional Review Board (WIRB), and will be monitored by an NIAAA appointed Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). We will conduct this study under an Investigational New Drug (IND) application from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is anticipated that a centrally located investigational pharmacy located at Indiana University will dispense the study medications to all participating sites under close coordination from the DCC-IU. Anakinra plus zinc, prednisone and matching placebos will be provided by the study to the participants. Interventions to be tested Concomitant treatments in this trial include standard care for severe AH for all participants as recommended in recent guidelines 1. The standard of care for severe AH includes attention to early diagnosis and treatment of bacterial and fungal infections, portal hypertension and its complications including acute kidney injury, gastrointestinal bleeding, fluid overload (ascites and edema) and hepatic encephalopathy. In addition, all participants will be offered as part of the standard of care, non-pharmacologic intervention for treatment of alcohol use disorders, such as cognitive behavioral therapy and 12-step programs intervention as aligned with the best practices at the participating study site. Participants with severe AH are very sick and often have multiple active medical problems requiring intervention. The use of specific interventions during this time has the potential to modify treatment response. Ideally, these interventions would be completely standardized. However, the standard of care varies by region, institution and the specialties involved in the care of the participant. The decision regarding treatments for these complications will be delegated to the primary physicians caring for the participants during hospitalizations and to the investigators during the ambulatory follow-up of the participants. Other than the general guidelines noted, no specific treatments for specific complications such as those noted are required. However, such treatments might include, but are not limited to the administration of IV fluids, intravenous human serum albumin, antibiotics including antifungal medications, renal replacement therapy, supplemental oxygen, assisted ventilation and intravenous pressors. Diagnostic procedures such as paracentesis, upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound and liver biopsy will be permitted as required to provide standard care. During the initial six months of trial, the investigators will develop a \"manual of clinical operations\" that will include best practices on the use of vasopressors, albumin, ICU care, mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy using Surviving Sepsis Campaign, International Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock. The investigators will also provide best practices for management of nutrition and alcohol counseling and minimization of recidivism. Although the management of these complications will not be mandated by protocol, the care provided will be recorded to develop novel designs for future trials and for practice guidance and quality improvement programs. After informed consent has been obtained and all of the inclusion are met and none of the exclusion, participants will be randomized to receive one of the following interventions in addition to standard care. Group 1: Standard of care plus prednisone 40 mg orally once daily on Days 1-30 and matching placebos for Anakinra (1 syringe s.c. once daily on Days 1-14), and zinc (matched pill once daily on Days 1-90). Group 2: Standard of care plus Anakinra (100 mg s.c.) once daily on Days 1-14 zinc sulfate 220 mg once daily on Days 1-90, and placebo for prednisone (matched pill once daily on Days 1-30). Figure 1. Distribution of study drug and placebo Participants or guardian will be instructed in subcutaneous injection technique to continue self-administration of these experimental treatments after discharge from the hospital. Study personnel will ensure participants and guardian are proficient in the technique before the end of study visit and an instructional document will be provided. Primary and Important Secondary Endpoints Primary Endpoints Survival at 90 days Secondary Endpoints Changes in score(s): Changes in Lille score, change in MELD score, development of AKI, multi-organ failure, SIRS, transfer to ICU, changes in liver function will all be evaluated at 7, 30 and 90 days. Organ dysfunction: Measure of changes in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores and proportions requiring hemodynamic support for MAP < 65 mm Hg and lactate > 2 mmol/l, renal replacement therapy or mechanical ventilation. The SOFA score will be modified and re-evaluated without platelet counts given that these are usually low in AH. Infections and Sepsis: The endpoints and case definitions related to sepsis may vary depending on what will be used (clinical care, research, surveillance or quality improvement). Given the central role of sepsis as a driver of outcomes, measuring the types of infection will occur but also identify the proportions of those with sepsis, septic shock or quick-SOFA (qSOFA) criteria based on SEPSIS-3 guidance 2, 3 . Key parameters will be captured and needed for various sepsis related endpoint construction aligned by the recent guidance from the European Drug Development Hub (http://eddh-cro.wixsite.com/fdtsfv). Renal dysfunction: In alignment with guidance from the acute disease quality initiative, the AKI development will be quantified and its progression through persistent AKI, acute kidney disease to chronic kidney disease. Need for care escalation: Proportion of participants requiring transfer to ICU for care, intubation for airway control, need for ventilator support or RRT. Indicators of gut permeability: (endotoxin and bacterial 18S DNA) and pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokines (TNFa, MCP1, IL-6, IL-1ß) will be assessed in serum/plasma samples. Survival at 30 days and 180 days Limitations of mortality as an endpoint in AH and plans to overcome these All-cause mortality is most relevant when mortality is substantial and attributable to a single mechanism in a homogeneous population. Participants with severe AH are highly heterogeneous with respect to disease severity, end organ involvement and the care they receive. Moreover, as in sepsis and heart failure, death involves failure of multiple organs (liver, heart, kidney, lungs) making it difficult to ascertain which one is the primary cause of death. This has led to development and regulatory acceptance of composite endpoints including mortality and key parameters driving mortality for acute heart failure trials. These guiding principles to construct a novel and innovative key secondary composite endpoint which will include death or worsening of the modified SOFA score 4, 5 by ≥2 points and worsening of MELD score by ≥2 points. These are associated with mortality and capture the organ recruitment that marks progression of AH towards death. This endpoint will also be validated with respect to reliability, construct-, criterion- and content validity to establish this as a primary endpoint in future trials. Model changes in SOFA scores and MELD scores against mortality to further optimize this endpoint and cross-validate it in the observation cohort will occur. Novel (experimental) endpoints to overcome limitations of conventional endpoints Efficacy endpoints must capture \"clinically meaningful benefit\". While traditional endpoints such as mortality are meaningful, they also have multiple shortcomings in the context of AH as noted below. Innovation will be used to construct, measure and validate novel additional endpoints to overcome the limitations of currently used endpoints and cross-validate them in the observational cohort. The combined expertise in endpoint development and the use of harmonized measurements will make this feasible. These will provide novel assessments in AH and provide the scientific evidence-base to use these as primary endpoints in future trials.

Investigational Sites Indiana University, Mayo Clinic, Virginia Commonwealth University, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, University of Louisville, and University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Planned number of Participants A total of 216 participants with sAH will be enrolled sequentially randomized into four treatment groups Objectives: To determine whether interventions directed to treat AUD integrated with sAH therapies will improve a composite endpoint of alcohol and liver-related events at 6 months compared to usual care for AUD (primary endpoint). To compare 90-day survival in patients receiving F-652 with those receiving up to 28 days of prednisone using the Day-7 Lille score as a stopping rule (secondary endpoint). To compare one-year overall survival in patients receiving either IL-22 or prednisone with or without acamprosate (secondary endpoint). Trial design and conduct We will conduct a prospective, multicenter, sequentially randomized trial in 216 patients with sAH using a sequentially randomized design for proof of concept. The trial will assess whether integrated treatment of sAH and alcohol use disorder (AUD) reduces alcohol- and liver-related events and mortality. The trial design resembles a 2X2 factorial study, but the AUD treatment assignment [acamprosate + motivational interviewing (MI) + motivational enhancement therapy (MET)] versus usual care (UC), defined as a brief intervention with advice not to drink alcohol-containing beverages and referral to a 12-step program, is done on Day 7 after the start of the sAH treatment. Only survivors of the first 7 days will be randomized to receive the AUD intervention or UC. Figure 1. Diagram of trial design Abbreviations: R: randomization, AUD: alcohol use disorder, MI: motivational interviewing, MET: motivational enhancement therapy. The study will be conducted at six clinical sites in the United States selected by the National Institute of Alcoholic Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) and supported by a Data Coordinating Center at Indiana University (DCC). The DCC will also manage the biorepository. The study will be conducted according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and in compliance with local, state, and federal regulatory requirements.

It is anticipated that a centrally located investigational pharmacy at Indiana University will dispense the study medications to all participating sites under close coordination from the DCC. The study will provide the participants with F-652, prednisone, matching placebos, and acamprosate. Duration of Trial by Phase Treatment phase: up to 6 months Follow-up phase: up to two years Interventions to be tested F-652 vs. prednisone as treatment for sAH. AUD interventions (acamprosate + MI + MET) versus usual care for AUD treatment. Group assignment: We will sequentially randomize the study participants into four treatment groups. On day 1, participants will be randomized to receive either F-652 or prednisone at a 1-to-1 ratio. Those randomized to receive F-652 will also receive a prednisone placebo; those randomized to receive prednisone will receive the F-652 placebo. Prednisone or prednisone placebo will be stopped if the Day-7 Lille score is >0.45. On day 7, survivors will be randomized to receive either the AUD intervention (acamprosate + MI + MET) or usual care at a 1-to-1 ratio. Block randomization will be used to ensure balanced group sizes in randomization. So, there will be four treatment combinations: ARM 1: F-652 on days 1 and 7 and matching placebos for prednisone for 28 days and acamprosate for 6 months. MI will be delivered during the hospitalization; MET sessions will be delivered in the first 3 months. ARM 2: F-652 on days 1 and 7 and matching placebo for prednisone for 28 days and usual care for AUD. ARM 3: Prednisone for 28 days and matching placebos for F-652 on days 1 and 7 and acamprosate for 6 months. MI will be delivered during the hospitalization; MET sessions will be delivered in the first 3 months.

Study data from completed trials and observational studies are available to qualified investigators, while data from ongoing projects will be released after publication of primary results. Policies guiding data and biospecimen use can be found in the Access Policy section. Clinical data are maintained in the Alcohol Research Data Commons (ARDaC), and investigators may submit requests through the Data and Sample Request Form. Upon review and approval by the Publication and Ancillary Study Subcommittee, the DCC will release the data. Code books for completed studies are provided to support data interpretation and secondary analyses. Data and Biospecimen Access Policy AlcHepNet supports responsible and equitable sharing of clinical data and biospecimens to advance research in alcohol-associated hepatitis. Requests are reviewed for scientific merit, feasibility, protection of participant confidentiality, and compliance with regulatory and IRB requirements. Priority access is given to AlcHepNet investigators, with opportunities for external researchers, particularly through collaboration with network members. Approved projects require data-use or material-transfer agreements, and users must return derived data and acknowledge AlcHepNet contributions in resulting publications.

With this approval, she will send the data dictionary for PI to review PI will create a table of data for request. Table should include: Subjects to include (i.e., healthy controls, those with 90-day mortality, RCT, etc.) Time points Specific data points such as those with liver transplant, AKI, PT/INR. Not \"outcome related clinical data\" Savannah will subsequently send to IU DCC for review IU DCC will prioritize requests as they come in.

    "content": "About AlcHepNet Learn more A Clinical Trial of Integrated Therapies for AH and AUD Learn more Previous Next About AlcHepNet AlcHepNet: The Alcohol-associated Hepatitis Network AlcHepNet is a collaborative research consortium supported by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA). Six leading academic medical centers work together to improve our understanding and treatment of alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) - a severe inflammatory liver condition linked to heavy alcohol use. AH is one of the most serious causes of liver-related illness and death worldwide. The causes and mechanisms behind the disease are not fully understood, and current treatment options are limited. AlcHepNet brings together experts in hepatology, addiction medicine, clinical trials, and basic science to: study how AH develops and progresses identify biological pathways that may be targeted for therapy conduct clinical trials to test promising new treatments improve outcomes and quality of life for patients and families affected by AH By combining resources and expertise, our network aims to accelerate discovery and translate scientific advances into better care. A Twitter List by AlcHepNet A Clinical Trial of Integrated Therapies for AH and AUD Advancing Treatment Through Research In the current funding cycle, AlcHepNet is conducting a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate new integrated therapies for patients with severe alcohol-associated hepatitis (sAH) and alcohol use disorder (AUD). The study’s primary goal is to determine whether combining novel therapy for sAH with treatment of the underlying alcohol use disorder (AUD) leads to better outcomes, including improved composite endpoints of liver and alcohol use events, in comparison with usual care. Participants in the integrated treatment arm receive: F-652, a human recombinant protein being studied for its regenerative and anti-inflammatory properties Acamprosate, an FDA-approved medication for AUD structured counseling focused on alcohol cessation The standard care arm receives brief counseling and referral to community-based support, such as 12-step programs. For more detailed information about the trial, see ClinicalTrials.gov. This trial represents a major step toward evidence-based therapy that treats both the liver disease and the underlying alcohol use disorder.
