						<h2 class="eligibility-heading text-center">ALCOHOL-ASSOCIATED HEPATITIS NETWORK OBSERVATIONAL
							STUDY</h2>
						<p class="lead">
							The purpose of this
							research study is to create
							a clinical database and
							bio-repository. To do this,
							we will obtain blood,
							urine, and stool samples
							(e.g., biological samples)
							and personal health
							information from you to
							use in future research
							studies related to
							alcohol-associated hepatitis or
							other diseases. Part of
							your blood sample will be
							used to extract your DNA.
							DNA is the genetic
							material that gives us
							unique characteristics. We
							are doing this research
							study because we are
							trying to find out more
							about how and why
							illnesses related to
							alcohol-associated hepatitis or
							other diseases occur in
							people. To do this, we will
							study the biological
							samples and personal
							health information from
							healthy and sick people.
						</p>
						<p class="lead">
							A "biological sample" is
							usually blood, but can be
							any body fluid. "Personal
							Health Information"
							includes such items as
							your name, age, gender,
							race, and/or your medical
							information. It can also
							include data from
							measurements and tests
							that you had while
							participating in another
							research study or that
							were done during the
							course of your regular
							medical care or doctor
							visits.
						</p>
						<h4>Study Type</h4>
						<p class="lead">
							Prospective, observational study
						</p>
						<h4>Investigational Sites</h4>
						<p class="lead">
							Indiana University; University of Louisville affiliated hospitals in Kentucky; University of
							Massachusetts Medical
							Center in Massachusetts; Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota; Cleveland Clinic Foundation,
							Ohio; University of
							Pittsburgh Medical Center in Pennsylvania; University of Texas at Southwestern in Dallas,
							Texas; and Virginia
							Commonwealth University in Richmond, Virginia
						</p>
						<h4>Planned Number of Patients</h4>
						<p class="lead">
							Approximately 1260 (720 subjects with alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH),
							360 heavy drinkers without AH, and 180 healthy donors) will be enrolled.
						</p>

						<h4>Objectives</h4>


						<p class="lead">
							<span class="objective-title">PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:</span> To collect and store clinical data
							to facilitate
							investigations of the epidemiology, diagnosis, pathophysiology, natural history,
							and treatment of alcohol-associated hepatitis.
						</p>
						<p class="lead">
							<span class="objective-title">SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: </span> To develop a bio-specimen bank
							comprised of plasma,
							DNA, and other biological specimens obtained from patients with alcohol-associated
							hepatitis,
							heavy drinkers without clinical liver disease, and healthy subjects to support translational
							research in the pathophysiology of alcohol-associated hepatitis
						</p>

						<h4>Methodology</h4>
						<p class="lead">
							<span class="phase-title">Screening phase:</span> Subjects will be assessed for the
							eligibility criteria and a written informed consent
							will be obtained from the eligible subjects.
						</p>
						<p class="lead">
							<span class="phase-title">Study phase:</span> Subjects will undergo history taking, physical
							examination, questionnaire administration,
							and laboratory tests. Biosamples including serum/plasma, peripheral mononuclear cells (at
							select sites),
							genomic DNA, stool samples (when available), urine, and liver tissue (where available) will
							be obtained.
						</p>
						<p class="lead">
							<span class="phase-title">Follow up phase:</span> Alcohol-associated hepatitis subjects will
							be followed for 360 days, Heavy drinking controls for
							180 days, and healthy controls subjects for 1 day (at initial meeting for baseline).
